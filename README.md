# console-blackjack
A small command-line teaching game to demonstrate programming concepts in C++ while playing Blackjack.

This application is compiled with GCC 4.2.1 in Mac OS/X 10.10 x64 during development. However, as long as you have GCC you should be fine; there isn't anything crazy going on in the source.

Since it's a C++ program you have to use g++ and not gcc:

	g++ Blackjack.cpp
